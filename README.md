# Heap / Priority Queue

## Difficulties

### Easy
- Kth Largest Element In a Stream   	
- Last Stone Weight

### Medium
- K Closest Points to Origin   	
- Kth Largest Element In An Array   	
- Task Scheduler   	
- Design Twitter 

### Hard
- Find Median From Data Stream

## Patterns
- Need to **repeatedly get min or max**
- Asked for **top K elements**
- Asked for **Kth smallest or largest**
- Data arrives as a **stream**
- Need to maintain **best K so far**
- Requires **dynamic ordering**
- Use of **min-heap or max-heap**
- Heap size often limited to **K**
- Involves **push and pop operations**
- Time complexity involves **log n**
- Asked to **merge sorted lists or arrays**
- Asked to **schedule tasks or intervals**
- Asked to find **closest / farthest elements**
- Asked to minimize or maximize **cost or time**
- Asked to find **running median**
- Requires storing **pairs or tuples**
- Comparison based on **custom key**
- Often combined with **hash map**
- Used in **greedy algorithms**
- Used for **interval problems**
- Heap replaces **sorting for efficiency**
- Involves **lazy deletion**
- Requires careful handling of **heap sign (negative for max-heap)**
- Can simulate **max-heap using min-heap**
- Rebalancing logic for **two heaps**
- Edge cases with **empty heap**
- Used when order matters **only at extremes**
- Helps avoid **O(n log n) full sort**
- Final answer depends on **heap top**
- Space complexity tied to **heap size**
